$ sudo apt install ansible
Error/Warning: If user not in the sudoers list, run the following commands

3. Creating SSH Key - Creates a public/private SSH key pair for secure password
less access.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "devops default"
ls -la .ssh
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
cat .ssh/id_rsa
4. Copying SSH Key to server - Enables password less SSH login by copying the key
to managed nodes.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub "ipaddress"
5. Testing the new Key - Verifies successful login to remote servers without a password.
ssh -i ~/.ssh/"keyname" "ipaddress"
Error: port 22, Connection Refused, run the following commands
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl restart sshd
6. Connecting to Server
ssh "Ip address"
7. Create Inventory File - Lists all managed servers in a structured format for Ansible
to use.
sudo nano inventory

[servers]
192.168.1.219
192.168.1.218

8. Ansible Command to connect with repository provided in the inventory
ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i inventory -m ping
Error: If permission Denied, run – “chmod 600 ~/.ssh
Inventory Testing - ansible all -i inventory -m ping
9. Creating playbook named playbook.yml
sudo nano playbook.yaml
playbook.yml
---
- name: Echo
hosts: servers
connection: local
tasks:
- name: print ping message
debug:
msg: Hello!

10. Executing playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
